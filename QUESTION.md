## Answers to these questions
- What are the main files and are all these included in `Project/`?
- Could you explain each file (.py files and mySavedDict.txt) under `Core/`?

- Do we need multiple_detect.py? Move it to `Project/Core` or `Additional/testProjects`.

- There is a `GUI` folder which contains GUI based .py files which was built by Krishna and me. I would like to move this to Web based GUI so that it looks more better and is automated. This gives an impression that the product is automated and rather not started from a command line.

- There is also a `OWL` folder which contains files which use owlready. I have no idea as to where the OWL is being used. Could you describe how OWL is being used here?
